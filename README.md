# Object/Traffic detection with YOLO v2
YOLO v2 Tensorflow implementation from scratch

![](ex_img/boxes.png)

I implemented the [YOLO v2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242) and trained it from scratch 
with tensorflow. For training I used [Udacity's public datasets](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations)

Videos with predictions can found here:
